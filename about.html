            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>My name is Augustinas Naslenas, I'm a freelance graphic artist and illustrator currently working out of Sheffield UK.
            Story telling and visual art have always been passions for as long as I can remember myself.
            My Dad told me he had started teaching me how to draw when I was only 4.</p>
            
            <p>In my late teens I became interested in Jungian psychology , Occult and magic traditions of various cultures.
            This involvement has been influencing my creative work since then and continues to do so.</p>
            
            <p>In 2015 I went through a difficult transformative initiatory experience.
            The Dream Reaper character was born in the fusion of this experience and the knowledge I had collected previously.
            The character quickly claimed his own life and expanded into different mediums and art forms such as performance, music, video,illustrated writing.</p>
            <p>The Dream Reaper - Escape from Soul City is the first one in a series of short stories based on dreams I have been having.
            This story took a form of a work in progress web comic. I decided to give you a middle segment of the story first and then add updates to the beginning and end. This way you will find not just what happened 'next'
            but also, what happened 'before'.
            </p>
            
            <p>I hope you enjoy it!</p>
